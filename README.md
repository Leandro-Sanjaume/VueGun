# Nuxt + Firebase Starter Template

A ready-to-go template for quick development of any application using Nuxt 3 and Firebase.

## Features

The following are included in this template:

- Ready-to-go `pinia` configuration, with an example store included.
- A simple `firebase-config.ts` plugin that initializes all the required Firebase features, which can be easily edited to add any other features one might need and change the values of the app configuration.
- `app.vue` configured to have the `NuxtLayout` and `NuxtPage` components instead of the default `NuxtWelcome`.

Simply make a page in `pages/` and get to coding!
